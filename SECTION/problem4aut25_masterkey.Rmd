\textbf{Learning Outcomes}

The problems are designed to build conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. The emphasis is on learning to find, evaluate and build confidence.
The specific tasks include: 

    - Identifying the range of discrete and continuous random variables
   
   - Deriving the PMF and CDF of a discrete random variable
   
   - Recognizing properties of CDFs
   
   - Back up and support work with relevant explanations

### Exercises 

1. For each situation, give the range of the random variable $X$. Then state whether the random variable is discrete or continuous.

a. $X$ is the number of employees among 12 recently hired that will still be with the company in another year.
    	
    The range is $\{0,1,2,\dots, 12\}$. $X$ is discrete since it takes finitely many values.
		
b. In a busy 24 hour copy center, minor malfunctions of the copy machine occur randomly. $X$ denotes the time (in hours) until the first minor malfunction occurs.
	 
	 The range is $[0, \infty)$. Here, $X$ can take any value in an interval and can (in theory) be measured with infinite precision. It is a continuous random variable even though it is being rounded to hours.
	 
2. 2. Suppose you toss a fair coin 3 times. The sample space for this experiment is shown below:
$$S = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, TTT,TTH, THT, THH \}.$$

a. Let $X$ denote the difference between number of heads and number of tails. Write the PMF of $X$ in a tabular format.   

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
    $x$ & -3 & -1 & 1 & 3 \\ \hline
    $f(x)$ & 1/8 & 3/8 & 3/8 & 1/8 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

b. Draw the probability histogram of $X$ in R. Comment on the appearance of the distribution such as shape, modality.

    ```{r prob-hist}
    # be sure to add library(tidyverse) in setup chunk. 
    #Do not add it here, we usually add packages in the setup code chunk
    #This code chunk has chunk options set so that the code is not printed,
    #messages while loading packages are not displayed, etc.

    ht_df <- tibble(
      x = c(-3,-1,1,3),
      f = c(1/8,3/8,3/8,1/8))

    ggplot(data=ht_df, 
         mapping = aes(x = x, y = f) )+
      geom_col(width = 1, alpha = 0.5,         #don't forget to set that width
           fill = "gold", color = "purple") +
      labs(title = "Probability Histogram of X",
            y = "probability",
            x = "X = x") #+
          #scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-3,-1,1,3))

    ```



3. Which of the following is a valid CDF? (choose one; also point out what's wrong with the ones you didn't choose)

Hint: make a sketch 

a. 
\begin{align*} 
        F(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 
                 0 & x < 0\\
                 \frac{1}{4} & 0 \leq x \leq 3 \\
                 \frac{3}{4} & 3 <  x < 5 \\
                 1 & 5 \leq x \end{array} \right. \end{align*}

    This is not a valid CDF because it is not right continuous at $x=3$. The function should take the value at the top of the jump.
    
b.
\begin{align*} 
        F(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 
                 0 & x < 0\\
                 \frac{1}{4} & 0 \leq x < 3 \\ 
                 \frac{3}{4} & 3 \leq x < 5 \\ 
                 1 & 5 \leq x \end{array} \right. \end{align*}

    This is a valid CDF because it is non-decreasing, right continuous, $F(\infty) = 1$ and $F(-\infty) = 0$.

c. 
\begin{align*} 
      F(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 
                 0 & x < 0\\
                 \frac{3}{4} & 0 \leq x < 3 \\ 
                 \frac{1}{4} & 3 \leq x < 5 \\ 
                 1 & 5 \leq x \end{array} \right. \end{align*}
   
This is not a valid CDF since it decreases at $x=3$. A CDF is always non-decreasing.


d.
\begin{align*} 
       F(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 
                 0 & x < 0\\
                 \frac{1}{4} & 0 \leq x < 3 \\ 
                 \frac{3}{4} & 3 \leq x < 5 \\ 
                 \frac{7}{8} & 5 \leq x \end{array}   
                 \right.                      
\end{align*}              

This is not a valid CDF since it does not converge to 1 as $x \rightarrow \infty$.

4. Write the PMF for the CDF that you identified as valid in problem 3. Also calculate the following probabilities using the CDF.  

    The PMF is
    \begin{align*}
    f(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
                      \frac{1}{4} & x = 0\\
                      \frac{1}{2} & x = 3 \\
                      \frac{1}{4} & x = 5
                      \end{array} \right.
    \end{align*}
    
    The following are probabilities calculated from the CDF in part b.
    
a. $P(X > 2)$ 

    This is simply $1 - P(X \leq 2) = 1 - F(2) = 1-\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$. 

b. $P(0.5 < X < 3.5)$

    We know $P(0.5 < X < 3.5) = P(X < 3.5) - P(X \leq 0.5)$. The first probability is simply the left hand limit of $F(x)$ at $x = 3.5$. Therefore $P(X < 3.5)= \frac{3}{4}$.
    The second probability is $F(0.5) = \frac{1}{4}$. Therefore $P(0.5 < X < 3.5) = 0.5$.
