### Instructions

- This homework is due in Gradescope on Wednesday Oct 29 by midnight PST. There is a 15 minute grace period and submissions made during this time will not be marked as late. Any work submitted past this period is considered late.  

- Please answer the following questions in the order in which they are posed. \textbf{Be sure to support your work and show your steps. All calculations must be done within your document and shown with the answer printed}

- Don't forget to (i) make a local copy this document for your work and to (ii) knit the document frequently to make sure there are no compilation errors. 

- When you are done, download the PDF file as instructed in section and submit it in Gradescope. \textbf{Do not forget to tag your answers to every sub-part of every question. We will take off 10\% for every part that is not tagged}

- \textbf{Please read the acceptable policies for this class in CANVAS. In particular, you are NOT ALLOWED to consult external sources - AI, tutors, tutoring sites, internet - to complete any part of this work. Do not use notation or definitions or results we have not covered in this class. We will deduct points for this. }

### Exercises 

1. 
a. (Shelley) Below are the last five lines of Shelley's poem *Ozymandias* 

   ```{verbatim}
   "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
    Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
    Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
    The lone and level sands stretch far away 
   ```

   Let $X$ denote the length of a word which is randomly selected from those lines. What is $X(\text{Ozymandias})$?  
  

b. (Free throws) As part of the warm up drill, each player on a basketball team is required to shoot free throws until a basket is made. If Amy has a 80% success rate at the foul line, \textbf{derive} the PMF of the random variable $X$ that describes the number of misses before she completes the drill. Assume that individual throws constitute independent events.

   Write the PMF of $X$ as a formula first, and then write a brief explanation below. Please see Example 5.5 from the discrete distribution slidedeck if you have any questions.
   
   \begin{align*}
   f(x) &=    
   \end{align*}
 
2. (Random walk) Suppose a particle moves 4 steps along the x-axis, starting at 0. At each step, it moves randomly one unit to the right or to the left. 

a. If you copy and paste the following question into ChatGPT: \emph{How many elements are in the sample space? Explain your answer very briefly }, you will get the answer shown in the file `HW4problem2-chatgpt.pdf` which is located in the COURSEMATERIALS/HOMEWORK folder. The number of elements is correctly calculated, however, there is an error made in the explanation for why. In your own words, describe the error and how you would fix it.
   
   Note: No hints will be given for this. The problem with ChatGPT's answer is literally ONE WORD.
   
b. Let $E$ denote the event that the particle ends up at $x = 0$. Write the outcomes in $E$ and calculate $P(E)$. 

c. Now suppose the random variable $X$ denotes the position of the particle after 4 steps. Write its PMF in a tabular format. I have created a partial table for you to fill in. Each row should contain a possible value $x$, then list the outcomes from the original sample space that give that possible value and the probability. (*Hint: in part b you calculated $P(X = 0)$.*)

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{PMF of $X$: position of particle after 4 steps}
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{4in}|r|} \hline
$x$ &  outcomes from $S$ & $f(x)$ \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

d. Create a code chunk and write code to draw the probability histogram of $X$, the position of the particle after 4 steps. Please see the slidedeck on chapter 6 for sample code. Be sure to give labels and a title. Do not use any code that you have not been taught in this class. (Note: you will need to load the **tidyverse** package in the Console if you wish to make the plot by running the code chunk interactively)

3. (Random walk revisited)

a. How would the PMF change in problem 2c change if the particle was twice as likely to move to the right as it is to the left? That is, the outcomes are no longer equally likely. Create a table showing the new PMF. Also clearly state any assumption you now need to make in order to re-calculate the probabilities. 

b. Draw the probability histogram of $X$, the position of the particle after 4 steps in this scenario. 


4. (Discrete Uniform) Suppose $X$ is a discrete uniform random variable on the integers $1, 2,\dots, n$, that is, it has PMF

    $$f(x) = P(X = x) = k, \ \ \ x = 1,2,\dots,n$$

    where $k$ is some unknown number. 

a. Find $k$.

b. Using  value of $k$ you found in part a, complete the  equation below to show the CDF  $F(x)$. Delete each blank and fill in the value of $F(x)$ for the corresponding interval. 


    \begin{align*}
     F(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                \underline{\hspace{2cm}}, & x < 1 \\[6pt]
                \underline{\hspace{2cm}}, & 1 \le x < 2 \\[6pt]
                \underline{\hspace{2cm}}, & 2 \le x < 3 \\[6pt]
                \vdots & \vdots \\[6pt]
                \underline{\hspace{2cm}}, & (n-1) \le x < n \\[6pt]
                \underline{\hspace{2cm}}, & x \ge n
                \end{array} \right.
    \end{align*}

c. Find $P(2.5 < X \leq (n-1)+\frac{1}{2})$. Show your steps using the CDF $F(x)$ rather than summing the PMF.

d. Define the random variable $Y = \frac{1}{X}$. Derive the PMF of $Y$. Be sure to back up your work.

    Hint: What values does $Y$ take? With what probabilities?
