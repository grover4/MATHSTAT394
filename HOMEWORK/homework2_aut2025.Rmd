### Instructions

- This homework is due in Gradescope on Wednesday Oct 15 by midnight PST. There is a 15 minute grace period and submissions made during this time will not be marked as late. Any work submitted past this period is considered late.  

- Please answer the following questions in the order in which they are posed. \textbf{Be sure to support your work and show your steps. All calculations must be done within your document and shown with the answer printed.}

- Don't forget to (i) make a local copy this document for your work and to (ii) knit the document frequently to make sure there are no compilation errors. 

- When you are done, download the PDF file as instructed in section and submit it in Gradescope. \textbf{Do not forget to tag your answers to every sub-part of every question. We will take off 10\% for every part that is not tagged}

- \textbf{Please read the acceptable policies for this class in CANVAS. In particular, you are NOT ALLOWED to consult external sources - AI, tutors, tutoring sites, internet - to complete any part of this work. Do not use notation or definitions or results we have not covered in this class. We will deduct points for this. }

### Exercises 

1. (Heads or Tails) Suppose 6 \emph{fair} coins are tossed and the outcome (head or tail) is recorded for each.  
   
a. The sample space $S$ corresponding to this "experiment" consists of all possible sequences of heads and tails that result from tossing 6 coins. How many elements are in $S$? Calculate the answer in a code chunk, save it to a variable called `num_S` and then print the value.  
   
b. Let $E$ denote the event that 4 of the 6 coins land on heads. How many elements are in $E$? Calculate this number in a code chunk, save your answer in a variable called `num_E` and print the value.  
   
c. Calculate $P(E)$ and in a code chunk and save it to variable called `prob_E` and print the value. Be sure to cite any rules you are using to make your theoretical probability calculation. 
   


2. (Tagging goldfish) To estimate the number $N$ of goldfish in a pond, $r = 25$ fish were caught, tagged and released. Later, a second sample of $n = 20$ fish were caught and 5 fish in this sample were noted to be tagged.  
 
a.  How many possible samples of size $n = 20$ can be formed from the $N$ fish in the pond?  Leave your answer in terms of a binomial coefficient since you cannot calculate it because you don't know $N$. 
    
b. The event $E$ contains all the samples which have 5 tagged and 15 untagged fish. How many elements are in the event $E$? Leave your answer in terms of $N$. 
   
c. Assuming each possible sample is equally likely, give an expression for $P(E)$. (Leave your answer in terms of $N$)

d.  In this part, we will examine visually how $P(E)$ varies as a function of $N$.  Fill in the blanks in the R code provided and run it in R to create the plot. **You should remove the `eval = FALSE` chunk option after filling in the blanks.**


    ```{r fish, eval=FALSE}

    fishes <- tibble( #enhanced data frame
              N = 40:200,    #possible values for N: 40,41, ...,200
              prob = ___ ) ) #P(E) in terms of N

    ggplot(data = fishes, 
           mapping = aes(x = ___,    
                         y = ___) ) +
           geom_line() +
             labs( title = " ___" ,
                  x = "___", 
                  y = "___")
    ```


e. If all went well, your graph should be unimodal with a peak at $N=100$. Just conceptually, explain what this pattern tells us about $P(E)$ and why it makes sense. Be sure to demonstrate your understanding of the location of the peak, as well as the increasing pattern before the peak and decreasing pattern after.

    Hint: Think in terms of the fraction of the population which is tagged and the fraction of the observed sample which is tagged to understand the pattern.

3. (Just acting) An actress playing the lead role in a film has a stunt double. According to the script, the actress appears in 40% of the filmâ€™s scenes, her double appears in 30%,
and the two of them are together 5% of the time. Find the probability that in a
given scene:

a. only the stunt double appears? 

b. neither the lead actress nor the double appears? 

    All calculations must be done within your document and shown with the answer printed.
    
    Hint: Let $L$ denote the event that the lead is in a scene and $D$ denotes that the double is in a scene. Clearly describe the events in a and b in set notation and show your steps for calculating them.  


4.  (Bounds) For two events $A$ and $B$ with $P(A)=0.5$ and $P(B)=0.8$, what are the largest and smallest possible values for $P(A \cap B)$? Be sure to show your work and explain the steps, referring to results from our notes. 

    Hint: Refer to Bonferroni's equality from Chapter 3 slidedeck and also the subset inequality from quiz section 2. You will need them.
